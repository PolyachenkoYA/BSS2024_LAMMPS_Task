Contains analysis scripts (Python) to extract budding times from LAMMPS simulations.

Will need some specific Python modules to run smoothly.

In order to set things up please create a virtual environent named BSS24 with conda by running

    conda create --name BSS24 python=3.9

Then activate it

    conda activate BSS24 

And install the required packages

    pip3 install ovito
    pip3 install freud-analysis
    pip3 install pandas
